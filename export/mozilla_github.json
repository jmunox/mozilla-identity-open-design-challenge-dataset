For this, I am a big supporter of texture design language, where we use different textures for various situations. This could be grunge, watercolours, sand, grain, cloth etc. We could differentiate ourselves from more sterile design languages, like Material Design, yet have enough flexibility to use the same design language across our mediums. Here is what I mean, I did 4 tests of the Mozilla logo in various textures (I love the water color concept).</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5436686/13807754/17ca2310-eb63-11e5-8536-556335a1c31c.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5436686/13807754/17ca2310-eb63-11e5-8536-556335a1c31c.jpg\" alt=\"draft\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p><p>This perfectly shows the diversity at Mozilla, and how we are different when communicating, not trying to pursue the latest design trends the big players experiment with. We need to keep away from extreme minimalism, yet have subtle messages in our visual communications, spreading warmth and security to the viewers. There will be a middle point between skeuomorphism and flat design, where we need to find our balance. We should not be visually cheesy by faking textures on our mediums, rather than enhancing the feel of our material very subtly.</p><p>For Mozilla's symbol, it might be a wiser choice not to choose a mascot, considering we already have a Fox representing Firefox (and inevitably also us).</p><p>What I was thinking of are snowflakes. Every single snowflake has a unique arrangement of crystals, making every snowflake unique. I do not know how well that could work out visually, but conceptually, it aligns very well with our vision.</p><p>Will update the thread with more thoughts of mine</p>      ",

But I have a few knowledge about branding and with that confidence giving it a shot!<br>While I was thinking about what could be the possible icon of Mozilla, I asked one of my fellow designer (named Subinoy Mustofi Eron) how he think about it. Then he created a basic outline of two person shaking hand. Which was almost a heart shape. After exploring that basic shape with love, ended up with this. That hand shaking may not reflect boldness or guts but it surely does reflect bond/strength. The heart may represents wellness/love/community, there are more ways to interpret a heart shape used in a versatile community. I have further explored with various color tone and gradient.<br>Now for the part of being trendy or not trendy, it is a simple logo but the gradient can distinguish it from being called a flat logo.<br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7550283/14042989/98904892-f2a9-11e5-97d2-cada1bd1b9d8.png\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7550283/14042989/98904892-f2a9-11e5-97d2-cada1bd1b9d8.png\" alt=\"mozilla-rebranding-pitch\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p><p>I also like elio's approach of pattern and watercolor background.

I have already explained the philosophy, here's some points on what this enables:</p><ol><li>The water itself is very \"amoebic\" in nature - you can play around with shapes to suit any branding content you're creating</li><li>There's enough flora and fauna to account for every logo, icon or t-shirt you'll want to design</li><li>It should be relatively easy to migrate existing brand material to an \"Aqua\" look and feel</li><li>Many choices in natural water body colour means you don't necessarily invent new colour guidelines for every Mozilla component, if you don't want to</li></ol><p>Let me know what you folks think!</p><p>I'm a relatively newbie designer desperately looking to get involved in an open design project. I read on the blogpost that you intend to involve an agency to work on the rebranding, so I decided to just sticking to writing my idea first.

The soft curves of the symbol you developed have a warmth and welcome that speak to the community aspect of Mozilla's brand. It's an invitation to participate. There does seem to be a similarity to the shape and feel of the Airbnb \"belo\" logo. It also makes me wonder if our symbol needs to reflect somehow the work that we do. If you saw this logo without first knowing Mozilla, would you have an understanding that we are an organization fighting for the free and open Internet?

Your point about changes in view ports driving design decisions is particularly insightful. I learned a lot. Thanks for sharing this.</p><p>A word of caution regarding exploring the pigeon as a symbol, as it evokes different feelings in different cultures. In urban areas in the U.S. for instance, the pigeon is seen as a symbol of blight and uncleanliness, for instance, rather than a mark of freedom. The dove is usually seen as a representation of peace (and sometimes freedom), so that might be a better aviary symbol if we were to go down that path.</p><p>I am not sure that animals, even though they have been a important part of our past design language, are going to be right for us going forward except as new products alongside Firefox. My hunch is that the symbol for Mozilla will not be animal based since that may not contribute to an understanding of what we do and believe in (although I could be wrong about this).

Do we take action and provoke a reaction like Greenpeace? Or are we here to educate and advocate, leaving the action to others?
